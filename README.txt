Generate sitemaps by grouping category posts, tags and custom taxonomies for better SEO analysis. Yoast SEO or Rank Math SEO must be active.

== Description ==
If you have Yoast SEO or Rank Math SEO installed (or their paid versions) this plugin helps you generate additional sitemaps for categories, tags and custom taxonomies.

Thanks to these sitemaps you can improve SEO analysis and know which taxonomies are being treated better by search engines in relation to the posts they have indexed.

With this analysis you can optimize those taxonomies more relevant to your business and try to maximize their indexation (increasing internal links, decreasing click depth,...).

In the plugin settings you can choose for which taxonomies you want to generate additional sitemaps and if you want to do it for all your terms or just a few selected ones.

The plugin is WPML Multilingual CMS compatible so you can generate sitemaps for taxonomies for each language.

== Installation ==
1. Visit the plugins page within your dashboard, select ‘Add New’ and search for ‘Super Sitemap for SEO’ or upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to the plugin settings after activation to choose your settings.

Remember that Yoast SEO or Rank Math SEO must be installed and active on your site. The link to the plugin settings will be added to the menu of the SEO plugin you have installed.
